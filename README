Attempt to write a read-only disk controller for a CDC 9762 Storage Module
Drive running on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).

Reference documentation for this family of drives:

Building:
 - Clone pico-sdk to somewhere: `git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk ; cd pico-sdk ; git submodule update --init`
 - Set `PICO_SDK_PATH`: `export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/clone/of/pico-sdk
 - Run `build.sh` (cmake must be installed; sorry about that, but pico-sdk is
   really forcing my hand)
